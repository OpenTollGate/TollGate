# TollGate - Prior Work Documentation

This repository serves as documentation for approaches that have already been tried when building TollGate. It helps new contributors understand TollGate's current state and learn from previously encountered challenges.

You can view the Documentation here: https://npub1suw0zfxerywd4zku4gjsjde22zhzye9dl2hsll6s3z2qap75p78s66lkhp.nsite.orangesync.tech

## Hosting this nsite

### Creating your own credentials

To get started with TollGate, you'll need to set up your nsite configuration. Use the `nsite-cli` command to begin the setup process:

```bash
$ nsite-cli
```

The setup wizard will guide you through the following steps:

1. Enter your NOSTR private key (or press Enter to create a new one)
2. Provide your website or project name
3. Add a project description
4. Configure your Blossom server URLs (default: https://nostr.download)

#### Example Setup Output
```bash
nsite:config Project file not found at .nsite/project.json +0ms
nsite-cli: No existing project configuration found. Setting up a new one:
✔ 1. Existing NOSTR private key (nsec/hex) (Enter to create a NEW one): 
✔ 2. Web site or project name: ...
✔ 3. Web site or project description: ...
? 5. Blossom server URLs: https://nostr.download
? 5. Blossom server URLs: Done.
nsite:config Project configuration saved to .nsite/project.json +41s
```

#### Uploading the nsite

* Upload to nsite using the following command:

```bash
~/TollDocs$ nsite-cli upload binaries/
  nsite upload called {
  force: false,
  purge: false,
  publishServerList: false,
  publishRelayList: false,
  publishProfile: false
} +0ms

* Tell npub1ye5ptcxfyyxl5vjvdjar2ua3f0hynkjzpx552mu5snj3qmx5pzjscpknpr that nsite-cli only works for whitelisted npubs if you get the following error:

```bash
Failed to read error response body: TypeError: body used already for: https://media-server.slidestr.net/upload
    at consumeBody (file:///home/pachai/make_nsite/nsite-cli/node_modules/node-fetch/src/body.js:196:9)

Error uploading 'index.html' Unexpected token 'P', "Public key"... is not valid JSON
```

You can use this one for now, but expect it to go rogue: https://github.com/OpenTollGate/TollGateNostrToolKit/blob/dockerize/.nsite/project.json#L2

* You can see your upload on URLs of the form: https://npub1suw0zfxerywd4zku4gjsjde22zhzye9dl2hsll6s3z2qap75p78s66lkhp.nsite.lol/

* You may find that the nsite refuses to update frequently. This is because nginx has a 1 hour cache on `nsite.lol`. Your site will update more quickly on `nsite.orangesync.tech`, because traffic is being routed through port 3000 on that machine.

#### Available Commands

Once configured, you can use the following commands:

- `upload <folder>`: Upload files from a directory
- `ls [npub]`: List all files available online
- `download <targetfolder> <npub>`: Download all files available online

For help with any command, use the `-h` or `--help` option.
